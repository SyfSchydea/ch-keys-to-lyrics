# ch-keys-to-lyrics

This script aims to make charting lyrics in Clone Hero charts easier. Instead of directly adding lyric events, 
notes can be placed temporarily in an unused chart, then converted using this script into lyric, phrase_start, 
and phrase_end events. This makes it easier to visualise, or hear the lyric timing in editors like Moonscraper.
